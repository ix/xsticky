* xsticky

xsticky is an immutable (not editable) pager (like ~less~ and ~more~)
for X11, which is so-called because it's great to use for sticky
notes.

It is written in Haskell and adheres to the KISS philosophy by trying
to avoid doing more than it needs to, as such, if you want multiple
notes, you should open multiple instances of the program.
